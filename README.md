In India while many of the farmers have left farming in search for better earning, newbie farmers are using technological advancements
to understand and care for crops.
Cropcare is trained on 16000 crop images from tomato,potato and others to classify them according to their disease. The convolutional neural network 
trained model achieves an accuracy of 96.78% on test data. Do view the notebook for the training process and model architecture. 

## Implementation on Streamlit

The model is converted to a h5 file and implemented using streamlit.
